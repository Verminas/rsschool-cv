## About me

I am 26 years old, for the last three years I have been working as a state medical forensic chemist in the department of the State Committee for Forensic Examinations in the Gomel region. I liked my work, but such activity in a state organization imposes some restrictions on me as a person. I have always wanted to try myself in an activity where I can fully reveal myself as a good specialist and as a creative person. Therefore, I opted for the profession of a front-end developer.

To describe my strengths, they would be:
+ multitasking
+ skill to work in team
+ self-learning ability
+ interest in everything new
+ perseverance
+ attentiveness

## Skills

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript (Basic)

## Code Example

```
function bmi(weight, height) {
  let bmi = weight / (height**2);
  if (bmi <= 18.5){
    return "Underweight";
  } else if (bmi <= 25.0){
    return "Normal";
  } else if (bmi <= 30.0){
    return "Overweight";
  } else if (bmi > 30){
    return "Obese";
  }
}
```
